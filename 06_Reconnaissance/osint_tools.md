# Reconnaissance & OSINT in Network Pentesting

Reconnaissance is the first and most critical phase of network penetration testing.  
The goal is to **collect maximum information with minimal interaction**.

## Passive Reconnaissance
Does not directly interact with the target.

Examples:
- Domain information
- Public IP ranges
- Email patterns
- Exposed services

### Tools Used
#### Hunter.io
- Identifies corporate email formats
- Helps build username lists for later testing

#### Shodan
- Searches internet-connected devices
- Identifies exposed services and versions
- Highlights outdated or vulnerable systems

#### SpiderFoot
- Automates OSINT collection
- Correlates data from multiple sources
- Produces visual graphs and reports

## Importance in Security
- Reduces blind exploitation
- Helps prioritize high-risk assets
- Mimics real attacker reconnaissance
