## 🕶️ Black-Box Penetration Testing

### 🔍 Overview
Black-box testing is performed **without any prior knowledge** of the target environment.  
The tester behaves exactly like an **external attacker on the internet**.

No information is provided about:
- Network architecture
- IP ranges
- Operating systems
- Credentials
- Internal applications

---

### 🧪 Testing Focus Areas
- Public IP addresses
- DNS and domain information
- Open ports and exposed services
- Web applications and APIs
- Firewall and IDS/IPS effectiveness
- VPN and remote access services

---

### 🛠 Common Techniques Used
- OSINT and reconnaissance
- Port scanning and service detection
- Web application attacks
- Exploiting misconfigured services
- Password attacks on exposed services

---

## 🌓 Gray-Box Penetration Testing

### 🔍 Overview
Gray-box testing provides the tester with **partial knowledge or limited access** to the target environment.

This approach simulates:
- A **malicious insider**
- A compromised employee account
- An attacker with limited initial access

---

### 🧪 Testing Focus Areas
- Authenticated web applications
- Internal network segments
- Active Directory configurations
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Credential reuse risks

---

### 🛠 Common Techniques Used
- Authenticated scanning
- Session management testing
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Lateral movement simulation
- Misconfiguration exploitation

---

### ✅ Advantages
- Balanced visibility and realism
- Faster and more efficient than black-box
- Identifies deeper vulnerabilities

---

## ⚪ White-Box Penetration Testing

### 🔍 Overview
White-box testing provides **complete knowledge and access** to the target environment.

The tester may receive:
- Network diagrams
- Source code
- Configuration files
- Credentials
- Architecture documentation

---

### 🧪 Testing Focus Areas
- Application source code
- Network configurations
- Authentication and authorization logic
- Cryptographic implementations
- Business logic flaws

---

### 🛠 Common Techniques Used
- Static code analysis
- Configuration review
- Advanced vulnerability testing
- Logic flaw identification
- Threat modeling
