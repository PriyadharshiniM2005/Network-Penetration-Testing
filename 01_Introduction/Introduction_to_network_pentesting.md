# Introduction to Network Penetration Testing

Network Penetration Testing evaluates how securely a network is designed, configured, and monitored by actively simulating attacker behavior.

Unlike vulnerability scanning alone, penetration testing attempts to:
- Exploit weaknesses
- Validate real impact
- Identify attack paths
- Assess detection and response capabilities

## Why Network Pentesting Matters
- Networks are the backbone of enterprise systems
- A single exposed service can lead to full compromise
- Many attacks begin with weak network configurations
- Helps organizations prioritize security investments

## Commonly Tested Network Assets
- Routers: Routing protocols, access control lists
- Switches: VLAN isolation, port security
- Firewalls: Rule misconfigurations
- Servers: Open ports, outdated services
- Services: Authentication, encryption, exposure
