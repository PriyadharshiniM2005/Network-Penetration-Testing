# Pass-the-Hash Attack (Conceptual Study)

Pass-the-Hash exploits NTLM authentication by reusing password hashes instead of plaintext credentials.

## Why This Attack is Dangerous
- No password cracking required
- Works even with strong passwords
- Enables lateral movement
- Common in internal breaches

## Defensive Measures
- Disable NTLM where possible
- Use Kerberos authentication
- Enforce least privilege
- Monitor credential usage
