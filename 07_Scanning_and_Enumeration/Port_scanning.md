# Port Scanning & Service Detection

Port scanning identifies which services are accessible on a target system.

## Nmap Scanning Techniques
- Ping scans for host discovery
- Full TCP scans for service exposure
- Version detection to identify vulnerabilities

## Analysis
Key fields to analyze:
- PORT: Entry point
- STATE: Open, filtered, closed
- SERVICE: Application running
- VERSION: Used for vulnerability research
